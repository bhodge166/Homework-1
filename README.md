# Homework-1
This code is a refactoring of a Search Engine Optimization website. The html code has been updated by adding semantic element tags and adding alt ids to images to improve accessibility. The CSS file has been consolidated, commented, and proper changes were made to get the finished product back to its original design. 

Screenshot of finished work can be seen below:
